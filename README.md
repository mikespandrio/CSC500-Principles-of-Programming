# Module 1: Critical Thinking Assignment

## Overview
This module introduces fundamental Python programming concepts through two basic arithmetic exercises.  
The assignment is divided into two parts: Part 1 focuses on addition and subtraction, and Part 2 focuses on multiplication and division.  
Each part includes pseudocode, source code, execution results, and repository submission requirements.

All files for this assignment are organized within the following directory:  
`/Module1/CriticalThinking`

## Part 1: Addition and Subtraction
**Objective:** Write a Python program that asks the user to input two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).  
The program should add the two numbers to find the sum and subtract them to find the difference.

**Files Included:**
- `add_and_subtract.py` — Python source file for Part 1  


---

## Part 2: Multiplication and Division
**Objective:** Write a Python program that asks the user to input two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).  
The program should multiply the two numbers to find the product and divide `num1` by `num2` to find the quotient.

**Files Included:**
- `multiply_and_divide.py` — Python source file for Part 2
